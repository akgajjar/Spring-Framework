-> It is Core Spring Project

-> we Have to Create Spring bean configuration file to create xml file 


* RowMapper

-> Like ResultSetExtractor, we can use RowMapper interface to fetch the records from the database
	 using query() method of JdbcTemplate class. In the execute of we need to pass the instance of 
	 RowMapper now.

* Syntax of query method using RowMapper
-> public T query(String sql,RowMapper<T> rm)  


* RowMapper Interface
-> RowMapper interface allows to map a row of the relations with the instance of user-defined class.
 It iterates the ResultSet internally and adds it into the collection. So we don't need to write a lot of 
 code to fetch the records as ResultSetExtractor.

* Advantage of RowMapper over ResultSetExtractor
-> RowMapper saves a lot of code becuase it internally adds the data of ResultSet into the collection.


* Method of RowMapper interface
-> It defines only one method mapRow that accepts ResultSet instance and int as the parameter list.
 Syntax of the method is given below:
	public T mapRow(ResultSet rs, int rowNumber)throws SQLException
